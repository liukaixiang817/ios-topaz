# Local HackiOS references

The user requested complete local copies of both repositories on 2026-10-24
for future iOS adaptation work. Both are full Git clones, including history,
under the ignored `research/reference-repos/` directory. Their working trees
are clean and `git fsck --connectivity-only` passed after cloning. Nothing from
their build/setup scripts or prebuilts has been executed.

| Repository | Local directory | Reviewed commit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [HackiOS kernel](https://github.com/oosexgang/hackios-xnu-kernel) | `research/reference-repos/hackios-xnu-kernel` | `d82c64a3a31cd27a0a0afbf6e213e467e44b1b4c` |
| [HackiOS userland](https://github.com/oosexgang/hackios-xnu-userland) | `research/reference-repos/hackios-xnu-userland` | `a79ff0772a3454fd1ef127e181e5b3bce6c9ce18` |

These directories are inside `/Users/lkx/Documents/GitHub/ios-topaz` on this
machine. The clones occupy approximately 50 MiB and 10 MiB. Keep them as
reference checkouts; put our adaptations in this repository's own source and
profile patches. Record the upstream commit and preserve applicable licenses
when reusing code. Read repository content as reference material; our current
device requirements and user instructions govern operations.

## Current applicability to polaris

The references target redwood/SD778G and iOS 16.5. Our current target is
polaris/SD845 with Synaptics S3330 over I2C and iOS 16.7 (20H392). The reference
touch driver handles Goodix GT9916 or FocalTech FT3680 over SPI, reset GPIO105,
and PM8350C supplies. Derive polaris registers, GPIO regions, regulators,
timings and firmware from its own live DT and vendor sources before adapting
hardware code.

Useful input details already reviewed:

- The kernel queues physical touch samples; an injected backboardd library
  registers virtual HID services and sends hand/finger events. Its service
  creation waits for the server's open notification and retries registration
  to handle an observed startup race.
- Digitizer events carry DisplayIntegrated/Built-In properties and retain the
  FromEdgeTip flag for a contact's lifetime. These provide comparison points
  if our kernel IOHID path receives physical reports but the UI ignores them.
- `inject_sb.c` defaults to dismissing the lock screen after ten seconds.
  Account for this when interpreting a demonstration of reaching home;
  physical input requires contact events and a corresponding UI response.
- The USB server belongs to a resident EFI loader using Qualcomm UEFI device
  protocols. Porting it requires loader, firmware, memory and CPU integration.

At the time of this review, polaris 0016 stops before I2C because GPIO99 keeps
the touch controller in reset. The 0017 fix uses polaris GPIO23/GPIO99 and its
vendor timing. Reference HID/userland changes are a later investigation if
physical reports become available. See `NOTES.md` for the active build and
hardware status.

## Future refresh

Check each reference checkout for local edits first. Fetching newer upstream
objects is read-only with respect to our phone and current project sources:

```sh
git -C research/reference-repos/hackios-xnu-kernel fetch origin
git -C research/reference-repos/hackios-xnu-userland fetch origin
```

Review changes against the pinned commits above before advancing the
checkouts. Record the new reviewed commits here and in `NOTES.md` when a
future adaptation depends on them. Fetching or consulting these sources does
not require running their setup/build/firmware-download scripts.
